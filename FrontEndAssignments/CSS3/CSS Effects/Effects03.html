<h2>Static</h2>
	<div class="static">Static block position...</div>
<h2>Relative</h2>
	<p>An element with position "relative" is positioned relative to its normal position.</p>
	<div class="relative">relative block position...</div>
<h2>fixed</h2>
	<p>An element with positon: fixed is positioned relative to the viewport,which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled</p>
	<div class="fixed">fixed block position...</div>
<h2>Absolute</h2>
	<p>An element with position: absolute;is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.</p>
